Axis Integration Instructions
================================================================================

More information on the integration of Axis can be found at:

To install Axis into Appfuse, you need to navigate to this
directory from the command line.  Then you can execute any of the following
targets with Ant. It might not be the most robust installer (it'll probably 
fail if run twice), but it seems to work good enough.

    	install    - which installs everything necessary to use the Spring native way of integration

Please notice that the lib directory of axis contains only minimal filesets. 
You are encouraged to get the full release with docs and examples. 
See the README files in the directory.
