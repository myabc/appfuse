AppFuse Core Archetype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're reading this then you've created your new project using Maven and
appfuse-core.  You have only created the shell of an AppFuse Java EE
application.  The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is ready to be tested as a backend JAR. The pom.xml file is
pre-defined with Hibernate as a persistence model. To change it, please read
http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Persistence.

To get started, please complete the following steps:

1. Download and install a MySQL 5.x database from 
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads.

2. Run "mvn test" to verify this application can talk to your database.
