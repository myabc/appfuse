AppFuse Basic Archetype
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're reading this then you've created your new project using Maven and
appfuse-archetype-basic.  You have only created the shell of an AppFuse JEE
application.  The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is web-ready using AppFuse static snapshot deployments. The
pom file is pre-defined with hibernate as a persistence model and Spring MVC
as the web MVC model.

To get started, please complete the following steps:

1. Download and install a MySQL 5.x database from 
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads.

2. Run "mvn jetty:run-war" and view the application at http://localhost:8080.
