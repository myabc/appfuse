Including and Excluding Classpath Resources

   The Warpath plugin allows fine grained control over the resources that are included on the classpath
   from the dependent war files. The following configuration would exclude all files called foo.resource
   from being included in the classpath:

+---------------------------------+
[...]
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.appfuse</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-warpath-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>add-classes</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
        <configuration>
          <warpathExcludes>**/foo.resource</warpathExcludes>
        </configuration>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
[...]
+---------------------------------+

   By default waparthIncludes is set to '**' (include everything) and warpathExcludes is set to blank
   (exclude nothing). Both parameters accept a comma separated list of patterns to match against file
   entries found below WEB-INF/classes on any dependent war included with the warpath type. The patterns will
   match against the portion of the path starting below WEB-INF/classes i.e. the pattern bar/foo.resource would
   match the file WEB-INF/classes/bar/foo.resource as it is found in any dependent warpath package. Note that a
   match using an excludes pattern takes precendence over a match on an includes pattern.
