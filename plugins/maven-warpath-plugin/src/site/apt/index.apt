Introduction

 The Warpath plugin extends the existing war overlay functionality included in the Maven War plugin to turn war artifacts
 into fully fledged build dependencies. It allows you to:

 * Develop with classes included in the war artifact /WEB-INF/classes directory by including them in the project classpath.

 * Automatically inherit transitive dependencies from the war artifact
   (the default Maven behaviour is not to inherit transitively from war dependencies).

 The Warpath artifact was originally developed for use in the {{{http://appfuse.dev.java.net}AppFuse}} project.
 A big thanks to all on {{{http://appfuse.dev.java.net}AppFuse}} for all the encouragement and help with development
 of the plugin!
