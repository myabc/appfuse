/*
 * This example program export contents of the repository directory into file system using
 * SVNKit library low level API.
 *
 * In general, approach we are using in this example is the same that is used for operations
 * like 'update', 'remote status', 'diff' or 'checkout'. The export operation is the most
 * simple one and allows to demonstrate this approach without going too much into the details.
 *
 * You may find and an article describing this (update) technique at
 * http://svnkit.com/kb/dev-guide-update-operation.html
 *
 * To perform any update-like operation one have to do the following:
 *
 * 1. Report the state of the client's working copy to the Subversion server. Of course, it could be
 *    'virtual' working copy, not necessary stored in the Subversion wc format or, in case of export or
 *    diff operation there could be no working copy at all, which is reflected in report.
 *
 *    Report is performed with the help ISVNReporter instance that is passed to the client's ISVNReporterBaton
 *    object at the moment report have to be sent.
 *
 * 2. Process instructions received from the server. These instructions describes how to modify working copy
 *    to make it be at the desirable revision. Amount of instructions depends on the report sent by the client.
 *    Different operations process received instructions in different manner. For instance, update operation
 *    updates working copy in the filsystem, remote status operation merely logs files and directories that
 *    have to be updated and displays this information.
 *
 *    With SVNKit API you may implement your own processing code, e.g. repository replication or custom merging code.
 *    ISVNEditor is the interface which implementations process update instructions sent by the server and in
 *    this example ISVNEditor implementation (ExportEditor) creates files and directories corresponding to those
 *    in the repository.
