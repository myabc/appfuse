Maven AppFuse Plugin

  This plugin provides code generation and other utilities for AppFuse 2.x projects. See the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} if you're
  having issues running this plugin.

* Goals Overview

  The Maven AppFuse Plugin has several goals.
  
  * {{{gen-model-mojo.html}appfuse:gen-model}}: Generates Java classes from database tables. 
  
  * {{{gen-mojo.html}appfuse:gen}}: Generates and installs Tests, DAOs, Managers, Controllers and Views based on POJOs.
  
  * {{{remove-mojo.html}appfuse:remove}}: Removes artifacts installed appfuse:gen.

  * {{{full-source-mojo.html}appfuse:full-source}}: Converts AppFuse basic projects to full-source with no AppFuse
    dependencies. Also renames packages to match your project's groupId.

  * {{{copy-templates-mojo.html}appfuse:copy-templates}}: Copies FreeMarker templates for CRUD generation into 
    src/test/resources/appfuse. These templates can be customized to fit your needs. You can delete the templates you
    don't customize and the default templates will be used instead.

  For a full list of goals, see {{{plugin-info.html}available goals}}.

  prior to 2.0.2, please see
