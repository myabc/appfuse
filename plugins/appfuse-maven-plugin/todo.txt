* don't hard-code id and Long everywhere
* allow 'web' modular project to read hibernate.cfg.xml from core.jar
  * currently, you have to copy hibernate.cfg.xml from core/src/main/resources
    to web/src/main/resources
* update documentation to explain usage and current issues
* create "full-source" mojo: svn export + adding dependencies
* change tutorials to reflect that applicationContext.xml might already exist

--> Release 2.0 M5

* tune down logging so users don't see output from plugin
* aggregate "gen and install" into single call (lifecycles?)
* prompt user for table or pojo and handle appropriately
* test and fix issues with ibatis and jpa (might be many since we expect hibernate.cfg.xml)

future
-----------
* add javadoc (so passes checkstyle)
